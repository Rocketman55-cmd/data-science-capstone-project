## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is a Udacity Nanodegree project. I decided to explore the Obesity Rate Among Adults Dataset from 1975 - 2016 collected by the World Health Organization. 

With the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic, the CDC lists obesity as a risk factor for the virus. Obesity is a medical condition that is characterized by excess body fat and a BMI of 30+. Obesity is the leading preventable cause of death in the world. Obesity is a worldwide disease that is prevalent in children and adults and I wanted to see the correlation between year, location, and sex. I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle. I will answer five questions from this dataset.

They are the following:

1. Which country has the highest obesity rate in the world and in what year for males? For females? For both sexes? Which country has the lowest obesity rate in the world and in what year for males? For females? For both sexes?

2. Which five different countries have the highest obesity rates in the world and in what year for males? For females? For both sexes? Which five different countries have the lowest obesity rates in the world and in what year for males? For females? For both sexes?

3. What are the top five years in obesity rates in South America for males? For females? For both sexes? What are the bottom five years in obesity rates in South America for males? For females? For both sexes?

4. What are the percentage breakdowns in average obesity rates for each continent for males in 2016? For females? For both sexes?

5. From 1975 - 2016, what are the worldwide trends in obesity rates for males, females, and both sexes?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

obesity-clean.csv has countries, years, obesity (%), and sexes as columns.

data.csv has sex and years as the columns and countries as the rows. The columns start at 2016 and go down to 1975 with a pattern of both sexes, males, and females.

There is also a jupyter notebook here that shows all of my work related to the five questions.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at this available [post](https://medium.com/@rocketmaninspace/how-have-obesity-percentages-changed-based-on-year-location-and-sex-98b3a052a135).
